# Contributing to recrypt

We welcome your involvement with this project, and we want to make the process of contributing to it as simple as possible.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.


## Contributing Code

We use a standard GitHub flow to managing contributions in the form of code changes.
If you would like to make some changes to the code and submit them back to us to be
included in the public recrypt repo, please follow these steps:


1. Fork the `recrypt` repo and create a branch for your changes.
2. Make code changes in that branch.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
8. Create a pull request from your fork back to the recrypt repo.

We'll review and take it from there.


## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept a pull request, we need each contributor (anyone who committed
code to the branch) to complete a [CLA](icla.pdf).

Alternately, we provide a [Corporate CLA](ocla.pdf) to cover contributions by
members of a company that want to contribute on the company's behalf.
